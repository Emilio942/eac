# Emergent Adaptive Core (EAC)

## A Self-Evolving AI Architecture

The Emergent Adaptive Core (EAC) is an experimental AI system designed to autonomously develop and refine its own problem-solving tools and architectural components, rather than implementing fixed solutions for predefined tasks.

## Core Concept

Instead of designing an AI system that solves specific tasks, EAC creates a system that builds its own tools to solve arbitrary problems - similar to how humans develop tools like language, mathematics, and physical tools.

## Key Components

### 1. Recursive Architecture Design
- Self-modification of core architecture
- Dynamic creation and removal of functional modules
- Self-diagnostic capabilities
- Architectural integrity maintenance during modifications

### 2. Internal Curiosity Engine
- Intrinsic motivation beyond task completion
- Exploration mechanisms for architectural innovation
- Balance between exploitation and exploration
- Measurement and optimization of curiosity-driven learning

### 3. Multi-Level Abstraction Learning
- Hierarchical concept formation
- Parallel processing of multiple abstraction levels
- Dynamic relationships between abstraction layers
- Bi-directional information flow between concrete and abstract concepts
- Cross-domain knowledge transfer

### 4. Controlled Randomness Framework
- Strategic exploration through controlled randomness
- Evaluation metrics for innovation attempts
- Efficient failure recognition and learning
- Balance between random exploration and systematic optimization

## Technical Requirements
- Operational stability during self-modification
- Robust safety constraints
- Traceable decision-making processes
- Performance metrics across evolutionary stages

## Installation and Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git init

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Documentation on how to use the EAC system will be added as the project develops.
